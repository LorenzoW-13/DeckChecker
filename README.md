# DeckChecker
This app answers to my personal need to keep a record of my Magic: the Gathering EDH decks, to help me manage real cards and proxy cards and keep track of the changes done more efficiently. NOTE: please read the README for license and use instructions and conditions

# Licenses and use conditions
Since this is a public and free repository, anyone is obviously free to use the app (once it's completed), however, since this is a strictly personal project and I didn't intend for it to be used by anyone but me, I've not provided, and will not be providing, any kind of license, terms of use ecc.
